# Introduction to Database 🚀❤️‍🔥

- A database is a structured way to store and manage data.
- It helps organize data for easy access, retrieval, and updates.
- Databases store data like tables, documents, or key-value pairs.
- They are used in applications to handle user and system data.
- Databases ensure data is consistent and available when needed.
- Examples include mySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

### Why Do We Need Databases?

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures data consistency. For example, in banking, a transaction either happens fully or not at all.
- **Concurrency Management:** Discuss how multiple users can access the same data simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Automatic processes to save data and restore it after failures.
- **Scalability:** Mention how databases are designed to handle growth from hundreds to millions of records.
