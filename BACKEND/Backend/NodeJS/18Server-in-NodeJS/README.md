# Creating a Web Server in Node.js HTTP Module in NodeJS 🚀❤️‍🔥

The `http module` in Node.js allows developers to create an HTTP server and handle client requests and server responses. It provides methods and properties to work with HTTP requests and responses, enabling the creation of REST APIs, web pages, and other networked applications.

A `web server` is software or hardware that serves web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to clients (usually browsers) over the internet or an intranet. It uses protocols like HTTP/HTTPS to handle requests and responses.
