# Streams and Buffers in Node.js | Simple File Copy Example with Events 🚀❤️‍🔥

### Streams and Buffers

- Streams in Node.js are a way to handle continuous flow of data.
- They enable reading or writing data piece by piece instead of loading the entire data into memory.
- A Buffer in Node.js is a temporary storage area for binary data.
- Buffers work as a chunk of data, enabling efficient data manipulation in streams.
- It helps to decrease memory consumption of your web server.
- There are four types of streams in Node.js Writable, Readable
  , Duplex, and Transform. But we won't cover everything in detail, as that would take a separate course if we wanted. We will teach what is needed for now.
