# Express Router Separating routes in Separate modules 🚀❤️‍🔥

### Separating routes in Separate modules

- A router in Express.js is a tool to define modular and reusable routes in an application.
- It is created using `express.Router()` to handle related routes together.
- Routes can be defined using methods like `router.get()` or `router.post()`.
- The router is mounted in the main app using `app.use("/basepath", router)`.
