# Validate Environment Variable in ExpressJS using Zod 🚀❤️‍🔥

- You might have many environment variables in your project, and ot's important to validate each one to ensure they are all present and correct.
- You can either handle this manually or, preferably, use a validation library like Zod.
- Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that allows you to define and validate the structure of your data easily.
- We will be using Zod for various validations in the future, so we'll also use it here to validate environment variables.
