# Query Parameters in Express | Real Examples & Practical Demo 🚀❤️‍🔥

### Query Parameters in Express

- `Query Parameters` are key-value pairs appended to a URL after a `?`, separated by `&`, like `/search?query=express&limit=10`.
- In Express.js, they can be accessed using `req.query`, which returns an object containing the parameters.
- For example, in `/search?page=4, req.query.page` will give "page".
- Query parameters are often used to pass original or filter data to the server without modifying the route.
- They are always a part of the URL and visible in the browser address bar.
